# Parallel Odd Even Transposition Sort 
 Odd-Even Transposition Sort is a parallel sorting algorithm. It is based on the Bubble Sort technique, which compares every 2 consecutive numbers in the array and swap them if first is greater than the second to get an ascending order array. It consists of 2 phases â€“ the odd phase and even phase:

Odd phase: Every odd indexed element is compared with the next even indexed element(considering 1-based indexing).
Even phase: Every even indexed element is compared with the next odd indexed element.
